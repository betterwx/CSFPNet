# Pre-trained model and testing
1. We provide the pre-trained models in 'epnet/'.

2. Note that you should place a named txt file in the directory of each dataset

3. Modify paths of pre-trained models and datasets.

4. Run test.py.

# Evaluation Tool
 You can use the [evaluation tool (python version)](https://github.com/lartpang/PySODEvalToolkit) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
